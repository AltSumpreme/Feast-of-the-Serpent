FEAST-of-the-SERPENT
This is a simple 2D Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game provides a classic Snake gaming experience where the player controls a snake to collect food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body and the screen edges.
(CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT)
**(MANY OF THE FEATURES ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND HENCE MAY HAVE BUGS OR HAVE NOT BEEN DEVELOPED)
 How to Play

1. Prerequisites:
   - Python 3.x installed on your system.
   - The Turtle graphics library is included in the Python standard library, so no additional installations are required.

2. **Clone the Repository:** 
3. **Run the Game:**

4. Game Controls:
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
- Try to eat the food (represented as a red circle) to grow longer.
- Avoid running into the walls or colliding with the snake's body, as this will end the game.

5. Scoring:
- Your score increases each time you eat food.
- Try to achieve the highest score possible.

6. Game Over:
- The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- You can restart the game by pressing the "Space" key after a game over.

Game Features

- Snake grows longer with each food item consumed.
- Game speed increases as the snake gets longer, making it more challenging.
- Simple and intuitive controls using arrow keys.
- Score display to track your progress.
